tests defining properties with integer names (expecting toString) seem to fail

{data,accessor}PropertyAttributesAreCorrect seem not to be in scope (required by test262), however if they were to be parsed that would probably be a bad thing since they use for-in

+0 and -0 evaluate to the same property name

the tests assume that the value of the [[Prototype]] internal property of the global object is Object.prototype, however this is not mandated by the spec, and indeed is not compatible with JSRef
